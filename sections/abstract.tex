Due to tremendous growth in communication technology, now it is a real
challenge to send some confidential data/information via communication
network. For this reason, several information security systems, such as
cryptography and steganography were developed.

The problem with cryptography is that it attracts unwanted attention
towards the encrypted information. Steganography overcomes that problem
by concealing the information in a career object (such as a media file)
in such a way that the career object remains practically identical to
the original one and no one suspects the hidden information.

So, in this project, we are basically trying to develop a simple
application that uses the concept of steganography to hide text files
(probably containing some secret messages) in a career media file
(eg. image file).
