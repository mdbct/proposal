\section{Proposed System}

In this project, we are going to develop a steganography application that is
small, simple and easy. Since we are just learning to program using OOP,
we won't be trying to build a \emph{big} software. Instead, we'll be building
a small software that does \emph{one} thing \emph{well}, and that one thing
is to \emph{encrypt/decrypt text files to/from image files}.
