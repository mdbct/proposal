\section{Project Scope}

Althought right now our objective is just to build a small and simple
steganography program that can hide text message in an image, steganography is
a very interesting concept which has a very bright scope in the future of
technology. It can be used as a beneficial tool for privacy, security, storing
passwords and other confidential informations. It can also be very helpful to
check terrorist activities.

This project can be extended, by adding more features and improving quality,
to one of the most popular and useful steganography applications.
