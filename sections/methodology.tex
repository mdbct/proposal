\section{Methodology}

To fulfill our objectives, we'll be using following concepts, algorithms,
or libraries:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{} Since we are dealing with image steganography in our project,
        we'll be using the least significant bit (LSB) algorithm to encrypt
        data in image. This algorithm is very common and is conceptually
        simple and probably the easiest to implement for new programmers like
        ourselves.

        All this algorithm does is use the LSB of pixels of image to
        contain the bits of the secret data.

    \item{} For image manipulation purposes, we'll be making use of the
        OpenCV library. It is a very popular, powerful and open-source
        image processing and computer vision library that will help us access
        the bits and pixels of images.

    \item{} We are aiming to possibly build a simple GUI for our program, and
        if we do so, we'll be most probably using the gtkmm (GTK+ binding for
        C++) library.
\end{itemize}
