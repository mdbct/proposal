This proposal is prepared for the project required for the partial fullfillment
of the academic requirement of the 3rd semester (2nd year, 1st part) of
Bachelors in Computer Engineering. Effort has been made to ensure that this
proposal is accurate and professional as far as possible.

We are very grateful to the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering
(DoECE) of IOE Central Campus, Pulchowk for providing us with this great
opportunity to develop a minor project. It will greatly enhance our knowledge
of object-oriented programming paradigm and will give us the valuable
experience of research and teamwork, which will definitely be of great help
for our career development.

We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our project co-ordinator,
Er. Daya Sagar Baral, for his supervision on the course of project
development.
