This proposal is prepared for the project required for the partial fullfillment
of the academic requirement of the 3rd semester (2nd year, 1st part) of
Bachelors in Computer Engineering. Effort has been made to ensure that this
proposal is accurate and professional as far as possible.

We are very grateful to our project co-ordinator Er. Daya Sagar Baral and to
the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering (DoECE) of IOE Central
Campus, Pulchowk for providing us with this great opportunity to develop a
minor project. It will greatly enhance our knowledge of object-oriented
programming paradigm and will give us the valuable experience of research and
teamwork, which will definitely be of great help for our career development.
